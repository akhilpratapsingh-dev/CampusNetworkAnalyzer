# Campus Network Analyzer

## About the Project
This project is a simple simulation of a campus network.  
It shows how IP addressing, VLANs, and basic security rules work.

The goal of this project is to understand networking concepts, not to build a real router.

## What This Project Does
- Checks whether an IP address is private or public
- Finds network and broadcast address
- Checks device communication using VLANs
- Applies basic security rules
- Detects duplicate IP addresses

## How the Project Works
The project is divided into four parts.

### IP and Subnet Check
The program analyzes a given IP address and subnet mask.

### Device Connectivity Check
Devices in the same VLAN can communicate.

### Security Rules
Some communication is blocked using simple rules.

### Innovation Feature
The program checks for duplicate IP addresses.

## Assumptions Made
- Subnet mask is 255.255.255.0
- Inter-VLAN routing is disabled
- Device details are hardcoded
